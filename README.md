MINI PROJECT 
ABSTRACT:
Autism is a complex spectrum disorder that is characterized by a range of symptoms, skills, and levels of disabilities. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, often around the age of 2 to 3 years. The symptoms of autism can vary widely form person to person, but they generally include difficulties in social interaction, communication challenges and restricted or repetitive behaviours. Some individuals can have excellent skills in certain areas, such as memory or math, while struggling with social interactions. Where others struggling with sensory sensitives, repetitive behaviours. For years scientists believed that cerebellum’s main function is to coordinate movements. But increasing evidence has shown that the cerebellum also plays an important role in cognition and social skills. There’s evidence that it not only regulates movements, but maybe cognition, wide range of other functions. Autistic brains often show a loss of specialized brain cells called “Purkinje cells”, which are responsible for carrying the signals out of cerebellum. This research focuses on harnessing Brain Computer Interface (BCI) data and deep learning techniques to enhance the understanding of autism and develop targeted interventions. The project is to leverage electroencephalogram(EEG) numerical data obtained through BCIs to uncover distinctive neural patterns associated with ASD. By collecting and analyzing EEG signals from both neuro-typical individuals and those with ASD, we aim to identify specific neural signatures linked to social interaction difficulties, sensory sensitive, repetitive behaviour. Deep Learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), will be employed to learn complex patterns within EEG data. These models will be trained to recognize subtle differences in brain activity that correlate with various ASD characteristics. Additionally, the project seeks to develop real-time algorithms capable of detecting momentary changes in neural patterns during social interactions or sensory experiences. The outcomes of this project hold significant implications for autism intervention. By deciphering neural markers associated with specific ASD traits, personalized interventions can be designed. These interventions may involve real time feedback mechanisms delivered through wearable devices or interactive applications, aiding individuals with ASD in recognizing and navigating social situations, managing sensory sensitivities, and reducing repetitive behaviors.
